# UnityBaxterIndoorCrowdSimulation

Motivation: Designing a simulation for evacuations at Baxter Arena. Providing an in-depth look 
at the infrastructure of Baxter when in a state of emergency. Looking at human-behavior when 
in a panic to leave Baxter. This can allow people to understand and develop proper plans for an 
emergency at Baxter Arena. 

Description: The project will be a simulation to showcase evacuation during both normal 
scenarios and during emergency situations at Baxter Arena. The simulation will allow users to 
see potential issues in the current design of Baxter in terms of exits and pathways or 
alternatively what areas of Baxter already work well in these scenarios.

Implementation Strategy: Currently the project is set to build using the Unity game engine 
using C# as the main programming language. We also plan on using Blender for the majority of 
assets while building a copy of Baxter Arena.
